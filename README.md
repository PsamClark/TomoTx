Transformer for the analysis of Sinogram for Computed Tomography.

This repo hosts code for the paper, `Masked Sinogram Model with Transformer for ill-Posed Computed Tomography Reconstruction: a Preliminary Study`, in prepration.
It is not progressing fast because of short of hands, if one really wants to see the draft, it's [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01356).
